Generating LLVM IR from C Source
********************************

The LLVMGen class will generate optimized and unoptimized LLVM by compiling the C source files listed in the txt file
generated by filtering the C files. This will then be used to train the ML Agent to transform optimized LLVM into unoptimized LLVM.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using optimized and unoptimized LLVM to train the ML Agent
	This approach has been chosen due to its ease of implementation. The ML Agent will attempt to bring optimized LLVM into unoptimized LLVM. The will allow it to transform any LLVM that is generated by lifting Clang-made executables. However, using  optimized LLVM as input heavily biases the model. The model will not be trained on realistic data. Additionally, more reasearch needs to be done to determine what other transformations are applied to the LLVM besides optimizations.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Default optimization level is none
	The default optimization level if not specified by the user is none. This does not mean that no passes are made. Rather, this level does the same passes that would be performed if a user did not include an optimization flag, and that is why it was chosem. The ability to change the optimization levels is provided in case it is later decided that this is insufficient. Level two (-O2, or -O) is the recommended opt-level to be used in that case, as this is the default used when ooptimization is specified, but no level is specified.

New location can be automatically created
	If the folder to hold the generated LLVM files does not exists, it can be specified and generated by the LLVM generator. This is to allow the folder structure to be built while using the tool. This can allow greater flexibility, perhaps allowing certain part of the data base to be stored in some folders and while others are stored elsewhere.
