McSema
******

McSema is one of the most robust tools I found. Because it is funded by DARPA and has
been around for awhile, I also believe it is likely to continue to be supported. Building
it is not possible on WSL Ubuntu. It might be possible to build it in a VM / seperate
install and still use the compiled binary. We could also use the docker image, but this
would require a change in the way we have configured our project (Travis and venv would
be different).
