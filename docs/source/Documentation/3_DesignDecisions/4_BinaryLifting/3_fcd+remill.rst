fcd+remill
**********

The remill fork of fcd through trail of bits. It seems to have more frequent commits, and has some of the advantages
of remill/mcsema (larger project, more support, perhaps better code generation, more support for platforms, etc.). I
would consider using this rather than fcd, however the worry comes as to whether it will continue to stay with fcd or
continue to fork off on its own or die off. I don't believe it would be too much work to switch to one or the other
after the fact however. FCD is rather modular by design so our "component" could likely be plugged in to either
without too much of a hiccup. Remill\McSema have a much more difficult build process which could be a deterent.
