bin2llvm
***********

First Impressions
    The README makes this project attractive because it says "It converts
    any binary code to LLVM. The resulting LLVM module contains functions.
    Some, control flow details are recovered."

Building bin2llvm
    The instructions are in the repository's README. It looks like it might require Docker.

    Building the project on WSL on a Windows machine failed.

    Building on a machine running Ubuntu 16.04 failed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion
    It is not usable since it cannot build on any machine the team has so far
    as can be told.
