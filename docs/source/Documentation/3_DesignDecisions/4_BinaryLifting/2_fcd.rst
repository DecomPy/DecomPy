fcd
***

First Impression
    fcd was a "bachelor's project" (capstone...?) for a single person a few years
    ago. Because of this, I question the quality of it. However, it is still being
    maintained and appears to be in decent working order. I also love that the main
    issue that he seems to be facing is the exact issue that we are trying to solve
    with out project. FCD is also an entire compiler that uses llvm, which means we
    may be able to use it for both the bin => llvm and the llvm => c portions of our
    project.

Building fcd
    fcd was much easier to build than many other projects. It was a little hard to find
    the instructions, but once I did, it built in way less time than llvm-mctoll and
    other projects I have looked at. This is mostly because it does not depend on llvm
    and clang source like other projects often due. I would much prefer to use a project
    of this style than part of an llvm toolset.

What is produced
    Unsure of the quality at this time as it is difficult to inspect the intermediate
    statges.
