Welcome to OpenMP Semantic Equivalence Findings's documentation!
================================================================

        A paper that which I read was about source to source translation in C++.
        It demonstrates the translation of a serial program with high-level abstraction to a
        lower-level parallel program in two separate phases. In the first phase
        OpenMP directives are introduced, driven by the semantics of high-level
        abstractions. Then the OpenMP directives are translated to a C++ program
        that explicitly creates and manages parallelism according to the specified
        directives. This article applies only to the C++ language.
