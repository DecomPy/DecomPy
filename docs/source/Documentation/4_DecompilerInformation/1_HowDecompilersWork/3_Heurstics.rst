Heuristics in HexRays
*********************

Many decompilers are based around using heuristics for repopulating
missing information lost in the decompilation process. Hex-Rays for
example using heuristics for type inferencing. These rules are used
to generate missing information on a "best guess" basis and are often
modular in nature. These rules do not hollistically make up a large
part of the decompilation process. They are not likely useful
for our purposes, but COULD be included as part of what we do.
