   .. tab:: Bastard Disassembler / libdiasm

      The Bastard Disassembler is a disassembler built for Linux / FreeBSD. It provides a library (libdiasm) which
      is intended to be used programmatically. It is written in C, but appears to have a python binding. There is poor
      documentation and it is difficult to find much on the usage. It also appears to be inactive.

   .. tab:: udis86

      Open source (2-clause BSD) C library for x86 and x86_64 dissasembly. It doesn't appear to have the best
      documentation, but it is at least present and usage seems simple, especially for what we would need to start.
      It does handle ELF files.
