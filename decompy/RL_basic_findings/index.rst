        A summary of A Beginner's Guide to Deep Reinforcement Learning

        Reinforcement learning refers to goal-oriented algorithms, which learn how to attain
        a complex objective (goal) or maximize along a particular dimension over many steps.
        Like a child incentivized by spankings and candy, these algorithms are penalized when
        they make the wrong decisions and rewarded when they make the right ones – this is
        reinforcement. Reinforcement learning can be understood using the concepts of agents,
        environments, states, actions and rewards.
       
        An agent takes actions. A is the set of all possible moves the agent can make. An agent
        can make an action from a list of actions. Environment is the world through which the
        agent moves. Unlike other forms of machine learning – such as supervised and unsupervised
        learning – reinforcement learning can only be thought about sequentially in terms of
        state-action pairs that occur one after the other.
       
        Reinforcement learning judges actions by the results they produce. It is goal oriented,
        and its aim is to learn sequences of actions that will lead an agent to achieve its goal,
        or maximize its objective function. Reinforcement learning differs from both supervised
        and unsupervised learning by how it interprets inputs.
       
        Unsupervised learning: That thing is like this other thing; perform anomaly detection by
        recognizing what is unusual or dissimilar.
       
        Supervised learning: These algorithms learn the correlations between data instances and
        their labels; that is, they require a labelled dataset.
       
        Reinforcement learning: Eat that thing because it tastes good and will keep you alive longer.
        The goal of reinforcement learning is to pick the best known action for any given state,
        which means the actions have to be ranked, and assigned values relative to one another.
       
        Reinforcement learning is iterative. In its most interesting applications, it doesn’t begin
        by knowing which rewards state-action pairs will produce. It learns those relations by running
        through states again and again, like athletes or musicians iterate through states in an attempt
        to improve their performance.
       
        Neural networks are the agent that learns to map state-action pairs to rewards.
