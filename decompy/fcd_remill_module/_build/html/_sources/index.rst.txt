   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Running fcd+Remill module's documentation!
=====================================================

    This directory has everything besides the fcd binary file.

    Unfortunately, the fcd+remill module does not run. The 
    attempted steps are provided in the README.txt.

    Error that stopped the module from running:

        Cannot find path to amd64 semantics bitcode file.

        Cannot find path to x86 semantics bitcode file.

        Note: These bitcode files are not being referring to the
              fcd binary file.
        
        The error is related to Remill; McSema support is very limited.
