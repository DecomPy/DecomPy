SER 401 Team 8 - Adaptive Machine Learning Decompiler Testing

1) Put your test cases into a relevant folder named `test_x` where `x` is your unique name.

2) Name your `.py` class as `ClassNameTest` where `ClassName` is the class you're testing.

3) Name your test functions and test classes with `test_function` where `function` is the name of the function or operation you are testing.

4) Make sure you import unittest and have
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
at the bottom.

5) Now you can run `pytest` from the terminal to run the tests.
