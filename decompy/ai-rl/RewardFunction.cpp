/* This will:
 *      Take in three strings which represent: PastLLVMFunction, CurrentLLVMFunction, NewLLVMFunction
 *      Convert those to LLVM Function objects
 *      Compare the PastLLVMFunction to the NewLLVMFunction to find the old difference
 *      Compare the CurrentLLVMFunction to the NewLLVMFunction to find the new difference
 *      Subtract the the old difference from the new difference to find the "improvement"
 *      Return improvement
